# Javabank
Simple bank operations management programme

JavaBank was a project started in the middle of the bootcamp after we got introduced to the Java fundamentals.

This application was going to be built along the next 5/6 weeks, so we could know what it's like to build an enterprise application to the real world.
The goal was to study some new library, framework or tool and then apply it to the JavaBank application.

We used a bank application that covers: User Interface, Client/Server Architecture, Relational Databases and Database Transactions.
